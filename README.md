<h1 style="font-family:futura;"Hello there!!!</h1>
<p>My name is Hellen, and welcome to my page. I majored in International Business with a minor in Design at UCSD.  After graduation, I would like to pursue a career that incorporates design thinking and hands on prototyping and development. I plan to go into industry to specialize in UX/UI Design but I would like to combine my knowledge I have learned as an international business major. I am currently available for opportunities in this field.</p>
